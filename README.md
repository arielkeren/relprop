# RelProp

**RelProp** is a high-performance, cross-language tool for enumerating and analyzing binary relations on finite sets. It computes, for each set size, how many relations satisfy a wide range of mathematical properties (such as reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, etc.), and provides both raw counts and percentages. RelProp is implemented in C, Rust, and Go, and includes utilities for result validation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Features

- **Efficient enumeration** of all binary relations for any set size (subject to computational limits).
- **Checks 17 standard properties** of binary relations, including combinations and rare properties.
- **Parallelized computation** for high performance (OpenMP in C, Rayon in Rust).
- **CSV output** of results for easy analysis and visualization.
- **Visualization tools** (Python/Jupyter) for plotting trends and correlations.
- **Validation utilities** (Go) to cross-check computed results against closed formulas.
- **Highly modular codebase**: C, Rust, and Go implementations, with shared logic and test suites.
- **Cross-platform Makefile** for easy building and cleaning (Windows-focused, but portable).
- **Mathematical background and references** included for each property.

## Output

- **CSV file** (`results.csv`) with columns for set size, time, total relations, and for each property: count and percentage.
- **Visualization**: Stacked area plots, correlation matrices, and more.
- **Validation**: Go tool checks computed counts against closed formulas.

## Mathematical Background

A **binary relation** on a set $S$ of finite cardinality (size) $n$ is a subset of the _cartesian multiplication_ of $S$ with itself. There are $2$ ^ $n^2$ possible binary relations on $S$. Each relation can be represented as an $n$ by $n$ Boolean matrix. In this project, for faster checking, bitwise operations are used, along with each relation being represented as a fixed array of unsigned integers.

**RelProp** systematically enumerates all such relations for a given $n$, and checks which properties each relation satisfies.
